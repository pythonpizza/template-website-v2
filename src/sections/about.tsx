        <b>Python Pizza</b> is a micro conference organized by the Python
        Hamburg Community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We bring the Python Community together for some amazing original Pizzaâ„¢
        and Python Talks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in and encourage practical sessions, in which developers
        share their experience and lessons from real-world projects, each talk
        is 10 mins long.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to the Python Pizza (Naples!) that started this format!</p>
